# Better Questions

Better Questions is a free, open-source tool that helps patients and caregivers generate research-backed questions to ask their doctors. It searches PubMed in real time and uses GPT to suggest medically relevant, citation-supported inquiries based on symptoms and known conditions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool does not provide medical advice or diagnoses. All results are generated from public literature. Always consult a licensed physician.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User enters up to 3 symptoms and 3 known conditions.
2. PubMed is queried for all valid subset combinations.
3. Articles are scored using the `article_scorer.py` system.
4. The top articles are passed to GPT to frame medically relevant questions.
5. Only citation-backed questions are returned, with clickable PubMed links.

## üß† Why This Matters

Diagnosing complex conditions is hard ‚Äî especially when symptoms are vague or overlap with other issues.  
Better Questions is designed to help patients **ask better-informed questions earlier**, using public research, not speculation.

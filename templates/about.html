    <h1>About Better Questions</h1>
    <p>
      Better Questions is a free tool designed to help patients surface medically-supported questions to ask their doctors—
      using trusted data from PubMed, not speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not attempt to diagnose. Instead, it connects symptoms and known conditions to peer-reviewed research, and frames
      questions you can take into your next appointment.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Might I Get No Results?</h2>
    <p>
      This tool is designed to avoid hallucinations. If no questions appear, it means no documented matches were found for <strong>all</strong> the
      symptoms and conditions you entered. Try entering fewer items or searching in smaller chunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In future versions, support for partial matches will be added—with clear labeling to protect accuracy.
    </p>
    <h2>Ethics & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Better Questions collects no personal data. It runs without user tracking, ads, or logins. You can even use it in private/incognito mode.
      It’s built for patients—not profit.

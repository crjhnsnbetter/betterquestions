# Better Questions — Ethical Clause (for Public Use)

This tool is distributed under the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license.
It is provided freely to empower patients and caregivers, not to exploit them.

By forking or deploying this project, you agree to:

- Not monetize user interaction via ads or manipulative upsells
- Clearly disclose any changes to the logic that affect medical relevance or data privacy
- Preserve or improve upon the citation-backed question logic
- Avoid token gating, paywalls, or usage throttles without providing a free tier

Any attempts to commercialize this codebase must clearly separate added value from what is freely available.
